# kutt-android
An Android client for [Kutt](http://kutt.it/).

# Maintenance Approach
As long as Kutt is hosted by someone and I have a free account that I can use custom domains on I am happy to maintain the app as much as my personal time permits!

That being said...
Donations help me prioritize my side projects :)
